    "I'm using the NYC food scrap drop-off sites dataset to create a chatbot that helps NYC residents find convenient locations to dispose of their food scraps for composting. This dataset is ideal because it contains location-specific information that the base OpenAI model wouldn't have access to, making the custom prompts significantly more valuable than generic responses.\n",
